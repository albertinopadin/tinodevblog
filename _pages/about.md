I'm Albertino, a software engineer in the Seattle area. Most folks call me Tino for short. I do personal projects mostly in Swift and Python, with a special interest in ML. You can go to my [YouTube](https://youtube.com/channel/UCknh5ffSftCIegfoZ6DhqGw) to see videos of my projects in action, and my [Github](https://github.com/albertinopadin) to see my code.
